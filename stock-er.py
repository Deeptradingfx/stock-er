# In this program, I attempt to build three different models that
# predict the prices of Apple Stock
# then plot them all on a graph to compare the results

# The steps would be:
# 1. Install Dependencies
# 2. Collect Dataset
# 3. Write Script
# 4. Analyze Graph

# Step 1: The four dependencies include:
# pip install csv - To read data from the stock prices
# pip install numpy - To perform calculations
# pip install scikit-learn - build a predictive model
# pip install matplotlib - plot datapoints on the model to analyze
